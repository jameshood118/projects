I have worked as a graphic designer and as a web developer, and in my own personal freelance work I have often been both at the same time. In 2015 I acquired new skills in my briefcase, these include: Shipping and Logistics, Ecommerce data entry, Amazon Vendor Central compliance, EDI data exchange as well as Quickbooks online. I have become more than just a Web Developer, and much more than just a face in the crowd.</p>',
