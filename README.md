One might ask themselvs why this exists, it could serve as a back up, it could serve as an idea dump

## Backstory
Every couple of years since Art Institute of Pittsburgh i've been remaking my portfolio, or re-launching I suppose. This is the longest it has gone without an update, as I was working for a private company that worked in government/emergency planning field. This means that most, if not all of my work was targetted towards that end and I didnt get much time to work on other things. Well, this portfolio is over 4 years old, and most of the packages i used for it are deprecated by now. So I plan on re-launching soon with new tech, in the same place, it'll replace/upgrade the old version.

Keep an eye out for changes
